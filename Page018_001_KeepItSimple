Keep it simple
no need to overcomplicate
"Make things as simple as possible, but not simpler" - Albert Einstein
Too much going on will distort your message.
Make sure that every element on the poster adds value and supports the message you are trying to deliver.
Beware of
- Too much text
- Too many colors
- Too many shapes or icons
If you have too many messages in one poster consider splitting in two.
