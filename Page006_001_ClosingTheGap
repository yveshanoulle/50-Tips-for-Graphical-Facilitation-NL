Facilitation model 5/7
Closing the gap
In all facilitation we gather data and hopefully generate some insight.
There is though a (high?) risk of loosing track of time - and forgetting to close the gap by bringing focus back to decide what to do and deciding on a result.
So in your preparation - followed by the 3 steps in the activity - remember to plan for how you will close the gap and create a tangible result able to use for post processing.
