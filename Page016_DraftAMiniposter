Mini poster an outline
create a draft version
It's always a good idea to create a draft version of your poster before drawing the "real" thing.
Take 1/4 of a piece of thick paper (160 or 200 gsm). Draw your headline and text. Add icons and other elements.
If you are not entirely satisfied: create another draft.
Good idea is also to test if your colors are working.
