Prepare learners
for what content to expect
Your audience will have easier remembering your content if you prepare them for what content they are about to receive.
A way of preparing them could be by having all posters hanging in the room - and then start the learning session with a walk of the room.
Ending the learning session in the same way could help the audience remembering vital points.
