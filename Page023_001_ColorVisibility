Color visibility
Colors and their surroundings
A colors intensity is dependent on its surroundings
So be aware of what colors you put next to each other.
Also be aware that 1 in 12 men (8%) and 1 in 200 women are affected by color blindness.
The most common form is known as red/green color blindness.
So using red or green colors to put emphasis on specific pointers could be invisible for 4,5% of your audience.
Consider therefore not only using colors but also other visuals, to make your point.
