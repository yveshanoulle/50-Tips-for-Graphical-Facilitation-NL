Use your shape - or don't
Pay attention to your felt tip
If the felt tip of your pen is uneven (like): pay attention to how you hold the pen.
To get evenly looking letters: you should use the wide side of the pen as much as possible, by turning the pen depending on what direction you are writing in.
With experience you can use the different parts of the uneven shape to create effects in your letters
e.g. START with light pressure and push harder towards end of letter
