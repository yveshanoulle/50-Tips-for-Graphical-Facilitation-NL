Use the room
Assets surround you
If you take a closer look at your surroundings there are hidden gems
Think about how you can actively use the room and it's resources.
- Walls
- Tables
- Can the room be divided into separate (logical) learning areas
- Can we hang strings and with clamps hang something from them
Make sure your creative use of the room don't disturb your message or alienates your audience.
Always move tables and chairs so they fit the way you want it.
