Facilitation model 7/7
Post processing
Know how to use the result
Start with the end in mind when planning any facilitation.
What is the change we want to have as a result of the meeting?
Consider elements like:
- What is the result going to be used for
- What form must it have for such use
- Who is going to use it
- When is it going to be used
- What detail level is needed
- Who must have agreed on which of the elements to move forward
- What are the next steps following

If you cannot answer this to a reasonable extend
Save time and postpone workshop!
