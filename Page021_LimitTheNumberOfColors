Limit the number of colors
more is often not better
If your colors are not used for expressing something specific - try to limit the number of different colors to a minimum
Think about what you are trying to say when deciding on what colors you use.
A good rule of thumb could be to use max. 3 different colors on a poster.
It could be ok to use a few more nuances (e.g. light or dark) for shadows and depth.
A good travel kit for graphic facilitation could consist of 5 pens: black, red, green, blue and grey.
