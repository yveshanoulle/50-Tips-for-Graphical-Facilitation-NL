Facilitation model 2/7
Set the scene
Facilitator starts the show with setting the scene
This activity has the purpose to clearly set expectations for everyone and should answer
- What is the topic
- Why am I here
- What is expected outcome
- How will outcome be used afterwards
- Are there rules we must adhere to
- What are the steps we must go through to get the expected outcome
This should also give participants enough information to leave if they think they cannot contribute.
Or decide to cancel the meeting if vital or key stakeholders are missing.
