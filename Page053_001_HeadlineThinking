Headlines
Think about your topic
The headline of your poster is one of the most important elements.
As it's (typically) the first thing that the receiver is reading on the poster, it's important that it's taking him/her in the right direction and preparing him/her for what is coming next.
A good headline could:
- Introduce the topic
- Ask a question
- Summarize content
