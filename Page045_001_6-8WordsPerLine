6-8 words per line
A good rule of thumb is to have between 6 and 8 words per line.
You can squeeze more words in per line by drawing your letters in a narrow font - and limit the space between the letters and words
As long as it's not at the expense of readability...
And varying font, sizes, spacing, etc can trick the brain to pay attention and remember.
You can limit your content by following the 7-7-7 rule: 7 pages in a presentation,
7 lines on page and 7 words per line.
